# Console Finances

## Description

My motivation with this project was to use JavaScript to analyse the financial data I was presented with. My aim was to display the total number of months, total profit and loss, the average change every month, and the greatest increase and decrease in profit and loss over the course of the time recorded, into the console. I learned how I can analyse the financial data using conditional (if... else) statements, JavaScript operators and for loops to track the values, which I stored into new variables when required. I also learned how to display a number to decimal places when using JavaScript.
